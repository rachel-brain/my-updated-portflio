# my-portfolio
BOOTCAMP - Week 8 assignment


## User Story

```
AS A upcoming web developer
I WANT to showcase my portfolio of deployed work samples
SO THAT I can present the best examples of my work so a potential employer can assess whether I am a good candidate for a position they have available
```

## Description
My motivation for undertaking this project was to update my portfolio with recent web development work.  It is to use as an adjunct to my resume, giving me the ability to present the best examples of my coding work.  It was also a good chance to refactor my code, where possible.

## Installation
Open the (index.html) page in your prefered browser to see the finished webpage which is responsive so can be viewed on a number of different screen sizes.

## Usage
Click on the images to be directed to the top of the page.  Note that, in this case, the top of the page has been used as a placeholder for when I add further work; in which case, clicking on the images will direct the user to the new work.

## Screenshot
A screenshot of the webpage on a desktop monitor can be seen in the assets at (assets/images/screenshot-of-deployed-website.png).

## License
The MIT License has been applied which can be seen in the source file at (LICENSE.txt).

## Tests
The main test run was to look at the site in multiple screen sizes, using the toggle device bar in the Dev Tools in the browser.  Unfortunately, at the time of publishing, the site was not perfect in all screen sizes & further debugging is required.  In particular, the aside was not re-sizing properly (due to padding set in pixels) & the text in capabilities was not always wrapping as the screen size reduced.  The resizing is still a bit clunky, not as smooth as I would have liked.
